# ESNext Generation Interactive Workshop

Javascript: The final frontier.

In this journey, we will explore the strange new worlds of ESNext's Iterators
and Generators.

We will seek out new ways to loop; new iterations.

We will boldly code what no one has coded before!

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jesstelford/esnext-generation.git
$ cd esnext-generation
$ ./runner.js
```

Select the first lesson using arrow keys, then press <enter>, and follow the
prompts.

## Help

Be sure to check your work first, which can often provide hints:

```
$ ./runner.js verify <your-file.js>
```
